# Digispark-DigiKeyboard-scripts--rubber-ducky-arduino-style-
Some payloads I created just to have fun with a Digispark, which is basically a very small Arduino board that you can plug in in a computer with a usb port.
Thus you can make it act as a usb-plugged keyboard and automatically type in whatever you want, as a usb rubber ducky would do.
